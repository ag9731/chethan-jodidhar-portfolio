          Chethan's filmmaking style is deeply rooted in the masala genre, where
          he masterfully blends action, drama, comedy, betrayal, revenge, and
          redemption. Although he made his debut with a genre-specific thriller,
          his later work has evolved into a unique amalgamation of high-stakes
          action and intimate emotional beats. While staying true to the
          fundamentals of mass entertainment, Chethan has developed a reputation
          for tackling contemporary social issues, often weaving vigilante
          themes into gripping stories.

          technically has allowed him to stay ahead of trends in an
          ever-changing cinematic landscape. With a keen eye for detail, he
          blends the power of technology with timeless storytelling techniques,
          resulting in films that are visually and narratively unique.
