          Renowned for his quick and efficient production schedules, Chethan is
          often referred to as a "producer's delight." His remarkable ability to
          manage large-scale productions within time and budget constraints has
          earned him recognition across the industry. A prime example of this
          efficiency is Timepass 2025, a ground-breaking project that completed
          its entire production in just 25 days. Despite the tight schedule, the
          film maintained high production values, showcasing Chethan's
          exceptional organizational and creative skills.

          Chethan’s reputation for speed and efficiency does not come at the
          cost of quality. He is committed to delivering films that meet both
          technical and artistic standards, even when the production requires a
          more intensive process. For example, with Vidhi (2021), the
          incorporation of complex VFX and CGI necessitated additional time, but
          Chethan’s unwavering focus on quality ensured the final product met
          his exacting standards.
